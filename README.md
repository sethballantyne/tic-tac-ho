# tic-tac-ho

Tic-tac-ho was created as a test bed for the initial version of Vee2D. It's tic-tac-toe, don't expect too much. The main point of interest is that it's pretty good example of how to write a game in lua that interacts with C++ code. 

As it stands, the player is red and the AI is yellow. This will change once the final art is finished. Playable binaries are in the zip archive. 

Erm. Have fun? :-P
